This folder contains results for running the circuit

|0>--X--H--U3(theta, 0, 0)--measure

at values of theta between 0 and 2pi in steps of 0.1.

These circuits were run on the IBM Q Experience website using the
drag and drop circuit editor (because my QISKit code throws a 404
generic error everytime I try to run it on ibmqx4).

The computer used was IBMQX4.

All operations were done on the first (zeroth) qubit q0.

Date experiments were run: Thursday morning 11-14-2018.

Number of shots in experiments was 8192 (max allowed on website interface).

NAMING CONVENTION FOR FILES:
----------------------------

distributionXY.csv is the data obtain for theta = X.Y (floating point value).
Here, X, Y are digits between 0 and 9.

For example:

distribution00.csv = data obtained for circuit with theta = 0.0
distribution21.csv = data obtained for circuit with theta = 2.1
distribution62.csv = data obtained for circuit with tehta = 6.2

The values of angles theta used were 0.0, 0.1, 0.2, ..., 6.1, 6.2.
